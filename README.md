# IoT based Smart Agriculture Monitoring System

Farming and agriculture is the basis of human life which give food, grains, and other raw materials. Recent technologies are playing a tremendous role in both increasing production and decreasing extra manpower in the field of farming and agriculture.

In this aspect, IoT can be used as a suitable solution for smart farming and agriculture. The main goal of this project is to design an IoT system for smart agriculture monitoring. There are several sensors available by which humidity, temperature, water level, soil moisture etc., can be measured. These sensors can be connected to a low cost micro-controller such as NodeMCU, which has inbuilt WiFI module to collect and process the sensory data folow.
